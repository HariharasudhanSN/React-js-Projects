His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand. His parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi. Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname "Dhauni".<br>
                   Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team, but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team. His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club <a style="color: purple;">(2001-2003)</a> Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the <a style="color: purple;">1997/98</a> season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-<a style="color: purple;">16</a> Championship, where he performed well.<br>

                    <h2>Early career</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <img src="dhoni2.jpeg">
                    <p>In <a style="color: purple;">1998</a> Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice President and Ranchi District Cricket President, to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. Till<a style="color: purple;"> 1998</a> Dhoni, who was in grade <a style="color: purple;">12</a> had never played professional cricket. At CCL, he got an opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to the A division.Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his selection in the Bihar team.Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year.</p>

                    <h2>Playing style</h2>
                    <gif src="dhoni3.jpeg"></gif>
                    <p>Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. Dhoni is an unorthodox batsman. He deviates from conventional coaching manuals and showcases his unique batting technique. Dhoni displays a proclivity for hitting full-length deliveries towards the Long-on, Long-off, and Midwicket regions, rather than the conventional Cover region. Furthermore, he demonstrates remarkable skill in playing pull shots and hook shots off short-pitched deliveries, putting pressure on the bowler to adjust their line and length accordingly. Dhoni holds the bat with a firm grip at the bottom of the handle, striking the ball with force and precision to clear the boundary. Despite this, he still retains the capability to produce awe-inspiring, long sixes. He is known for his unorthodox captaincy and cool-headed demeanor on the field. As a batsman, he is recognized for his remarkable finishing skills in high-pressure situations, and his aggressive captaincy has earned him the reputation of a successful leader in Indian cricket. He has also been renowned for his lightning-fast glove-work behind the stumps.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Initially, Dhoni appeared as a lower-order attacking batsman but he gradually changed his playing style to deal with high-pressure scenarios and his growing responsibility as a captain. He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.He made use of the helicopter shot technique, taught to him by a fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.

                        His wicket-keeping skill is widely praised by cricket experts but also criticised for lack of good technique. He has a world record for the highest number of stumpings by any wicket-keeper.
                        
                        As a captain, Dhoni was approachable to players. Former cricketers and opposition players underline that his behaviour on cricket ground was calm and composed. He used to allow his bowlers to set field for themselves.</p>
